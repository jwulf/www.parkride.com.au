  heading: Start a Ride
  text:
    - Park Ride is a grass-roots movement. A Park Ride is built around someone who is a host and a guide, sometimes around a group of people who share the leadership. They make sure that someone is there to welcome new participants, and tends to the mood of the community. Park Ride is inclusive and diverse. People of all ages, abilities, and experience levels participate - and anyone can be a tribal leader.
