blurb:
  heading: Find a Park Ride
  text:
    - Find a local ride on the website, or start one in your area. Rock up before 8am on Sunday, and ride with others, for great justice!

    - The ride is a to-and-from ride, with a social break in the middle to grab a cup of coffee and for kids to play in the park. Ride at your own pace, and everyone catches up when you arrive at the mid-way point.
